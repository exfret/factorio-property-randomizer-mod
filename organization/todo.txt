0.2.3
 - Make better things randomize to be better usually (maybe a setting if people want to turn this off)
 - icon_size spidertron visual thing

0.2.2
 - Work on customized settings
 - Work on crash
 - Lab speed going to zero
 - Make bias setting more clear

Get distance based randomization up
Add crafting cost to randomization
Add power level normalizer to keep power levels similar to what they were at start

Clean up data-final-fixes

Next releases:

  - Have simply including reformat do the reformatting so I don't have to call any of its functions
  - Add chaos mode

  - Test mod compatibility
  - Do special evaluation of the "importance" of items to randomize their crafting times more effectively
  - In-game tutorial/tooltips for more obscure randomizations
  - Refactor so that each function called in data-final-fixes uses each prototype exactly once
  - Randomly randomized mode where which settings are randomized is randomized
  - Add "separation function"

  - Get random map settings working with modded game
  - Randomize collision masks
  - Learn about fluid boxes and randomize those
  - Randomize collision boxes (do more carefully than before, like also changing graphics)
  - Shuffle damage types (advanced randomization)
  - Recipes randomly require water
  - Crafting times less variance for items needed for science
  - Sample from gamma distribution for simpler properties
  - Use local functions instead of globals
  - Randomize research tree
  - Link inserters (specifically, filter inserters/fast inserters, for example, should be hard linked)
  - Account for efficiency when rounding energy_used for furnaces (and other such objects)
  - Round min consumption
  - Check for extra properties in params for randomize_numerical_property to catch errors
  - Make mid-game changing of character values work for existing saves
  - Optional mod dependencies with "extra thing" mods in mind
  - Add recommended mods (increased inventory)
  - Add special "compatibilities" for vanilla (and for other mods?)
  - prg_key for group randomizations
  - Option for resistances outside of 0-100
  - Increase burner inserter and non-machine things' stats when they're burner energy sources
  - Add option to only change some recipe times
  - Function for find_separation_bias
  - Documentation for randomization_algorithms
  - Max factor changeable with setting
  - Change color of lights/lamps/labs to disco/different colors
  - Make prg_key for entities depend on properties being randomized too
  - Make grenade range circle correct
  - Make miniloaders display correct speed
  - Seperate out energy property names
  - Re-round electric pole numbers
  - Extract building the dependency graph out into a separate file
  - Add smart collision box logic to power poles again
  - Modify inserter rotation speed based on the new randomized position
  - Inerter power requirements higher variance?
  - In compatibilities, make sure burner or regular inserters aren't cursed (or maybe at least not all those and long inserters)
  - Make setting to make things biased toward the player
  - Check that I make sure inserters aren't too slow for belts
  - Randomize technology bonus amounts (like bullet damage increase)
  - Randomize reach distance mid-game

Organization
  - Insert {randomization_function, prototype, property} tables into randomizing_functions_to_call instead of just functions to call
  - Make a proper readme

Random maps
  - Randomize enemy evolution parameters
  - Randomize pollution parameters

Configuration options
  - Add option for variance

Support
  - Space Exploration support

Properties:
  - Gun shooting speed and range
  - Biter pollution absorbed
  - emissions_per_second
  - healing_per_tick
  - fuel_acceleration/top-speed multiplier (randomize with vehicles)
  - braking_power/braking_force
  - Localizations

Silly additions
  - Figure out a way to randomize sounds or graphics?
  - Randomize what rocks drop
  - Mining ores gives you random items sometimes (a random other ore?)
    - Maybe to make it not just dangoreus lite, it gives something like the smelted version? Or something else that adds more complications than something you just throw into some chests?
  - Mining a building can, with a small chance, give you another building of the same "type"
  - Biters randomly spawn across the map (possibly even in your base)
  - Properties are randomized based on where the entity is located
  - Properties get re-randomized after each rocket launch
  - Weird things can take modules, like electric poles? Enemy spawners? Inserters?
  - Randomly change what's being researched without notice
