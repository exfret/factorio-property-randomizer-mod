Here are some ways to randomize the "factorio dependency graph"...

1. The Scan Method

The process is to look at what can be reached in the old dependency graph using things in the new one, and then choose something in the old one that can be reached and add that in some way with dependencies in the old. This way, the structure of "this comes before that" is somewhat kept.

2. The Card Method

Each thing is given a "card". The first element of a random card type is brought over at each step, with the same dependencies as what would have been in that position. This keeps the relative positions of things within cards, like the assembling machine upgrades.

3. The Cut and Paste Method

The sets of in-edges of nodes are cut and pasted onto new nodes in a similar way as to the card method.

4. The Swap Method

Swap edges in a "criss-cross" way if possible while preserving doability.

5. The Reverse Card Method

Rather than bringing over the first element of a random card, bring over a random element of the same card that would have been in that spot. This keeps the "type" of things in order, while randomizing
