Compatibility
1. Add blacklist for wide chests

Future versions
1. Rounding modes other than the default are currently broken
2. Crash with icon randomizer and other mods (in this case, pyanodons)

Can't reproduce
1. Steam randomizing to less than 100 degrees

Can't Fix
1. Incompatibility with info mods: Need other mods to add hidden optional dependency on mine so they load afterward
