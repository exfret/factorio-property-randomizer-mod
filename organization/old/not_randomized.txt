Notes:
    1. Doesn't include justification for visual properties (those are just confusing to randomize usually)
    2. Justification is not required for properties that would obviously be very silly and unnoticeable anyways

CircuitNetworkConnectable
    circuit_wire_max_distance

Accumulator
    default_output_signal

Achievement

AmmoCategory - All
    I don't see a sensible way of randomizing ammo categories, they're mostly just names of things anyways.

AmbientSound - All
    Maybe could switch around ambients sounds without it being too wack, but I don't see this changing much or even being noticeable

Circuit Connectables - Circuit Wire Max Distance
    Probably wouldn't be noticed except when it is, and would then be unenjoyable.

Energy Source - Electric - Usage Priority
    Just makes things nonsensical and painful, would be confusing to players.

Resistances
    Is complicated to do right and I'm not sure how to do it yet.
