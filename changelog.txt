Version: 0.1.3
Date: ?
  Features:
    - Implemented more rounding rules
    - Added ability to randomize character crafting and running speeds midgame
    - Added group armor resistance randomization (and group resistance randomization capabilities in general)
    - Added group randomization for beacons and other things (too lazy to list all of them)
  Minor Features:
    - Added compatibility with abnormal inserter collision boxes (currently I just ignore these inserters)
  Changes:
    - Rounding no longer applies automatically to new randomizations
    - Logistics radius and connection distance are now simultaneously randomized rather than the more contrived process I was using before
    - Resistances are now only modified with a 1/10th chance
    - Hid the armor resistance feature (too hard to balance for now)
    - Electric pole wire reach is now set to be a little bigger than the supply area at a minimum
  Organization:
    - Separated out property info tables, prototype tables, inertia functions, and walk_params tables into their own new files
  Balancing:
    - Rebalanced electric poles to have lower variance and be slightly more generous toward the player (again)
    - Bugs and other similar things have less swingy health randomization (before it was possible to just get mobbed by them)
  Bugfixes:
    - randomize_numerical_property now interacts with most of its params "by value" (this fixes a lot of bugs introduced by separating out the property tables)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2022.06.18
  Features:
    - Added simultaneous randomization for assembly machines
    - Added ability to find which prototypes are of the same "type" using next_upgrade
    - Randomized mining drill base productivity
    - Rounding is now present and configurable (though the rounding parameters haven't been fully set yet, so they way some things are rounded might not make sense)
  Balancing:
    - Made electric pole randomization more generous to the player
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed issue with rounding not being applied
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
