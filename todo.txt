Goals for 0.2.0:
  1. Rounding pretty much completely implemented
  2. Distance group randomization started up

Next releases:
  1. Implement auto-testing (to whatever limited extent I can)
  2. Distance-related group randomization

  - Investigate which entities take pollution and how
  - Test mod compatibility
  - Do special evaluation of the "importance" of items to randomize their crafting times more effectively
  - In-game tutorial/tooltips for more obscure randomizations
  - Refactor so that each function called in data-final-fixes uses each prototype exactly once
  - Randomly randomized mode where which settings are randomized is randomized
  - Add "separation function"

  - Randomize biter spawner in a smarter fashion
  - Learn about fluid boxes and randomize those
  - Randomize collision boxes (do more carefully than before, like also changing graphics)
  - Shuffle damage types (advanced randomization)
  - Recipes randomly require water
  - Crafting times less variance for items need for science
  - Sample from gamma distribution for simpler properties
  - Use local functions instead of globals
  - Player chooses between different prototypes
  - Randomize research tree
  - Link inserters (specifically, filter inserters/fast inserters, for example, should be hard linked)
  - Account for efficiency when rounding energy_used for furnaces (and other such objects)
  - Round min consumption
  - Check for extra properties in params for randomize_numerical_property to catch errors
  - Make mid-game changing of character values work for existing saves
  - Optional mod dependencies with "extra thing" mods in mind
  - Add recommended mods (increased inventory)
  - Add special "compaitibilities" for vanilla (and for other mods?)
  - Add thumbnail
  - prg_key for group randomizations
  - Hard link logistics chest inventory sizes
  - Option for resistances outside of 0-100
  - Increase burner inserter and non-machine things' stats when they're burner energy sources
  - Add option to only change some recipe times
  - Function for find_separation_bias
  - Documentation for randomization_algorithms
  - Add offshoots for furnace speeds and such (just like with stack sizes)
  - Max factor changeable with setting
  - Change color of lights/lamps/labs to disco/different colors
  - Make prg_key for entities depend on properties being randomized too

Organization
  - Insert {randomization_function, prototype, property} tables into randomizing_functions_to_call instead of just functions to call
  - Make a proper readme
  - Compare config file to other mods to see how it is

Random maps
  - Randomize enemy evolution parameters
  - Randomize pollution parameters

Configuration options
  - Sync belt tiers option
  - Add option for variance

Properties:
  - Gun shooting speed and range
  - Biter pollution absorbed
  - emissions_per_second
  - healing_per_tick
  - fuel_acceleration/top-speed multiplier (randomize with vehicles)
  - braking_power/braking_force
  - electric pole wire connection points (so it's possible electric poles connect to fewer electrical poles than before)

Silly additions
  - Figure out a way to randomize sounds or graphics?
  - Randomize what rocks drop
  - Mining ores gives you random items sometimes (a random other ore?)
    - Maybe to make it not just dangoreus lite, it gives something like the smelted version? Or something else that adds more complications than something you just throw into some chests?
  - Mining a building can, with a small chance, give you another building of the same "type"
  - Biters randomly spawn across the map (possibly even in your base)
  - Randomize map colors for entities
  - Properties are randomized based on where the entity is located
  - Properties get re-randomized after each rocket launch
  - Weird things can take modules, like electric poles? Enemy spawners? Inserters?
  - Randomly change what's being researched without notice
