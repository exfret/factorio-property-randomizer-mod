random=Every map setting is randomized.

propertyrandomizer-rounding-mode-murder the rightmost digits=Make numbers very rounded. Numbers should only contain 1-2 nonzero digits. Note: rounding may break some properties that rely on lower order digits.
propertyrandomizer-rounding-mode-round-ish=Round a little bit. Let me choose where rounding makes the most sense and round a bit off the edges there. Note: rounding may break some properties that rely on lower order digits.
propertyrandomizer-rounding-mode-leave 'em raw and unrounded=Don't round. See all the numbers naked in their full glory.

title_randomization_list=List of Things Randomized
page_randomization_list_text_1=Note that this page may be outdated. It should at least give an idea of what things get randomized, though.
page_randomization_list_character_values=A. Randomize character values: Re-randomizes character movement speed and crafting speed bonuses every 30 minutes.
page_randomization_list_crafting_times=B. Randomize recipe crafting times: Just randomizes the times that recipes take.
page_randomization_list_entity_sizes=C. Randomize entity sizes: Currently just randomizes cliffs.
page_randomization_list_inserter_positions=D. Randomize inserter positions: Randomizes where inserters drop off and pick up things. There is a 1/3 chance for each to be randomized on any inserter, and when randomized the new position is chosen from some manually decided options.
page_randomization_list_logistics=E. Randomize logistics:\n    (1) Belt speeds are randomized\n    (2) Bot movement speeds and charging speeds are randomized\n    (3) Electric pole reach distance and supply area\n    (4) Inserter speeds\n    (5) Pump speeds\n    (6) Underground reach distance\n    (7) Vehicle speeds/accelerations/braking forces
page_randomization_list_military=F. Randomize military:\n    (1) Ammo damage\n    (2) Random things about consumables (including grenades/fish), like use speed and throwing/use range\n    (3) Gun damage modifiers, speeds, and ranges\n    (4) The health of everything (more senstive things like biter health are randomized less randomly)

page_luckiness_text_1=This is placeholder for now, since there are technical issues with the implementation. In the future, it will say where you got lucky/unlucky with your randomization.
page_luckiness_text_1_new=This is a breakdown of where you got unlucky/lucky. Refer to this if you're unsure whether to be disgusted or delighted.
